# Cold_Code_KO

This is a website that when first loaded up you get an intro screen and the ability to view the leaderboard or start the quiz. When the quiz is initiated, a timer will pop up in the top right corner and you will be presented with a question and four choices for an answer. If the correct answer is chosen, then a message appears saying "Right Jab!", or if it's incorrect, then a message of "Boo! Get up . . ." appears. Also, if the answer is incorrect the timer loses 10 seconds. 

Once the quiz is finished the user is presented with a for to submit the initials along with the score appearing above the initials form. When the form is submitted then your initals are stored alongside your score on a leaderboard. If you wanted to play again you can hit the "play again" button and if you want to clear the scores then you hit the "clear leaderboard".
